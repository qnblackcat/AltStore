## _What is this?_

👉 This is my AltStore repo :package: It contains all of my tweaked apps, such as:
- [uYouPlus](https://github.com/qnblackcat/uYouPlus/)
- [CercubePlus](https://github.com/qnblackcat/CercubePlus/)
- [CercubePlus (Legacy)](https://github.com/qnblackcat/CercubePlus/tree/iOS-12)
- [BHTwitterPlus](https://github.com/qnblackcat/BHTwitter-Plus_Sideloaded/) 
- **Facebook Wolf**

_Unfortunately, AltStore can not handle two (or more) applications that have the same bundle ID (uYou+, Cercube+ and Cercube+ (Legacy)). I have no other choice except to modify CercubePlus's bundle ID. As a result, you won't be able to install CercubePlus directly through AltStore. You still can download the IPA like normal though._

👉 To add the repo to AltStore, simply select **Add to AltStore** at the top of the page. For now, this feature is only available for patrons of AltStore.

👉 Not a patron of AltStore? You can view the repo and download the latest IPA by selecting **View the source**.
